{"name":"FreeNAS","tagline":"FreeNAS Git Repository","body":"## IMPORTANT NOTE:  This is the master branch of freenas, which is used only for the creation and testing of 9.3-Nightlies builds.  If you are building or developing for:\r\n\r\n* FreeNAS 10:\tUse the freenas10/development branch (and see the README there)\r\n* 9.3-STABLE:\tUse the 9.3-STABLE branch\r\n\r\n# Building FreeNAS\r\n\r\nTo build the system (experts only):\r\n\r\n## Requirements:\r\n\r\n* Your build environment must be FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE (building on\r\n  FreeBSD 10 or 11 is not supported at this time).\r\n\r\n* an amd64 capable processor.  8GB of memory, or an equal/greater amount\r\n  of swap space, is also required\r\n\r\n* You will need the following ports/packages when compiling anything\r\n  FreeNAS-related:\r\n  * ports-mgmt/poudriere-devel\r\n  * devel/git\r\n  * sysutils/cdrtools\r\n  * archivers/pxz\r\n  * lang/python (2.7 or later, with THREADS support)\r\n  * sysutils/grub2-pcbsd\r\n  * sysutils/xorriso\r\n  * py27-sphinx\r\n  * py27-sphinxcontrib-httpdomain-1.2.1\r\n  (and all the dependencies that these ports/pkgs install, of course)\r\n\r\n## Building the System Quickstart Flow:\r\n\r\n* Checking out the code from git:\r\n\r\n```\r\n% cd /path/to/your-build-filesystem\r\n% git clone git://github.com/freenas/freenas.git\r\n% cd freenas\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Build it\r\n\r\n```\r\n% make git-external\r\n% make checkout\r\n% make release\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Update the source tree, to pull in new source code changes\r\n\r\n```\r\n% make update\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will also fetch TrueOS and ports for the build from github.\r\n\r\n## The End Result:\r\n\r\nIf your build completes successfully, you'll have 64 bit release products in\r\nthe release_stage directory.  You will also have a tarball in your build\r\ndirectory containing the entire release for easy transport.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
